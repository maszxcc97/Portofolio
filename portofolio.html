        <p>
            Since I was a Junior high school, I have been deeply passionate about technology, especially in the field of 
            <b>engineering</b> and <b>programming</b>. For me, coding is not just about writing lines of code — 
            it is an art of solving problems and creating innovative solutions. I believe that a true engineer is 
            someone who can harness technology to make human life easier and more efficient.
        </p>
        <p>
            My journey into coding started from pure curiosity. From creating simple programs, developing small applications, 
            to exploring more complex programming languages — every line of code I write takes me one step closer 
            to my dream: becoming a professional <b>engineer</b> who can make a real impact on the world.
        </p>
        <p>
            I believe that the future of technology lies in the hands of young innovators. I aspire to be part of that generation, 
            driving positive change through innovation, creativity, and dedication in the world of engineering.
